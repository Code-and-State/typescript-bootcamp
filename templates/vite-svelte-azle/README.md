This project template gives you everything you need to build a Web3 application on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/).

For an example of a real-world dapp built using this template, check out the [source code](https://github.com/dfinity/feedback) for DFINITY's [Developer Experience Feedback Board](https://dx.internetcomputer.org/).

## Create a New Project

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 16.x` and [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) `>= 0.12.x` are installed on your system.

Run the following commands in a new, empty project directory:

```sh
npx degit rvanasa/vite-react-motoko # Download this starter project
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background
npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings

npm start # Start the development server
```

When ready, run `dfx deploy` to build and deploy your application.

## Tips and Tricks

- Customize your project's code style by editing the `.prettierrc` file and then running `npm run format`.
- Reduce the latency of update calls by passing the `--emulator` flag to `dfx start`.
- Install a Motoko package by running `npx ic-mops add <package-name>`. Here is a [list of available packages](https://mops.one/).
- Split your frontend and backend console output by running `npm run frontend` and `npm run backend` in separate terminals.
