> The bootcamp was originally held from August 21st to 27th, but all of its resources are now permanently accessible. You are welcome to work on the project, view the recorded workshops, and follow the day-by-day guides at your own pace. If you complete the requirements, you can still earn your graduation certificate. Just fill out the graduation form, which is regularly reviewed for new submissions. **Best of luck.**

## Goal üéØ
Build a DAO. <p>

> A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, represents a novel form of collaboration. Leveraging blockchain technology, we are creating software that enables more efficient and transparent collaborative efforts.
