# Day 5

## Introduction ðŸ‘‹
Welcome back for Day 5! Kudos for making it until here. We are approaching the end. 

Our DAO is currently still in itâ€™s infancy. The reason? We havenâ€™t implemented any functionality yet. Itâ€™s time to give super-power to our DAOs. Itâ€™s also time to use your creativity. DAOs can be used for multiple of functionalities:

- They can manage resources like a treasury.
- They might be responsible for running a social media and controlling the algorithm.
- It's possible for them to control a physical object (yes).
- They can govern an entire network, as weâ€™ve seen with the NNS.
- They could oversee an NFT collection. Voting on art and designs for collection.
- They might run and manage a DeFi protocol, just like the Uniswap DAO does.
- In the future, they could even handle things like organizing bootcamps or producing educational content (working on this one ðŸ˜‰).

I understand that it might seem unusual: first building the DAO and then figuring out its purpose. But remember, we're here to experiment and learn. In reality, as your project moves forward, the features and roles of your DAO would naturally evolve and grow.
## Goal(s) of the day ðŸŽ¯
The goal of the day is simple: **add something for you DAO to do or manage**. It could be anything. Here are a few directions, but feel free to explore and use your creativity:

- Oversee a website. Motoko Bootcamp participants tackled this one. It's a fun task if you're feeling short on inspiration.
- Supervise another canister, calling its functions. What functions? That's your puzzle to solve.
- Manage a treasury or wallet, like a Bitcoin or ckBTC treasury.
- Call a Web2 service through HTTP outcalls, and use it to manage an account on a Web2 platform.
- Manage another token or NFT (creation, minting, burning, etc.)
- Manage an entire application, like a chat application or a game. Thatâ€™s what SNS projects are doing.
- Handle a neuron (Axon DAO is a live project already doing it, but you can offer a fresh take)
- Control a physical object, like manoeuvring a robot or printing a message. This one's is very advanced, but in theory possible.

At the end of the day, here are you goals:

- [ ]  Something happens whenever a proposal is passed.
