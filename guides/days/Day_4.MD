# Day 4
## Introduction ðŸ‘‹
If youâ€™re reading this, youâ€™re a true hero. We are now more than 50% towards the end of this camp. Today we will talk about the core of what a DAO do: **taking decisions**.
## Goal(s) of the day ðŸŽ¯
When a DAO has to make key decisions about finances, the future plan, or any action, members need to agree. This is usually done through voting. Every member can suggest ideas and vote on them. If you hold more tokens, your vote carries more weight because it usually represents more involvement. Simple as that. Depending on the DAO there might be other factors taken into account to weight each vote such as:

Some DAOs consider other factors when weighing votes, like:

- How long tokens have been locked.
- How long someone's been a member.
- Other aspects, like a person's role or status in the DAO.

But for this project, we recommend that you keep it simple and just base the vote's weight on the token count (but feel free to explore different systems if you feel like it). 

Your task for today? Set up the voting system for the DAO. 

By the end of the day, here are your goals:

- [ ]  Users are able to create proposals.
- [ ]  Users are able to vote on proposals.
- [ ]  Proposals are passed whenever a consensus is reached.
