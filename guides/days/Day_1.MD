# Day 1

## Introduction üëã

Welcome to the elite **Web3 with TypeScript Bootcamp**, where talented minds like yours gather to learn and master the art of programming on the **Internet Computer**.

Today marks your exciting first day, and while it may be intense, take the chance to bond with your teammates and brace yourself for the adventure ahead. 

Don't worry if you fall behind; allow yourself the time needed to grasp the material. Keep in mind that 7 days is a brief period to learn everything there is to know about **Web 3.0** and the **Internet Computer.** All resources will be available after the week is over, so you can catch-up on anything you've missed.

Above all, the most important aspect of this week is to have fun, build connections and learn.

## Goal(s) of the day üéØ

Today's objectives are to familiarize yourself with the **Internet Computer** and the concept of a **DAO**. We will also ensure you understand what we're going to build in the upcoming days, and most importantly, why we want to built it. 

By the end of the day, here are your goals:

- [ ]  You have a basic understanding of the Internet Computer and how it works.
- [ ]  You have successfully downloaded and setup one of the starter template.  The project is running locally.
- [ ]  You have acquired cycles and can deploy canisters on the Internet Computer.
- [ ]  You have a basic understanding of what is a DAO and how to start your project.
- [ ]  You are excited to be pioneering a new way to organize humans and society üòé
