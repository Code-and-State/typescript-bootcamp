# Project requirements

### ****ü§î¬†Motivation****

This Bootcamp is not a hackathon, and should not be approached as a competitive event. The primary purpose is to be a shared effort to promote the Internet Computer, and train a new generation of developers. 

However, we strongly believe that building a complete application is the best way to help you acquire all the necessary knowledge to build on the Internet Computer.

### ****‚òëÔ∏è¬†Requirements****

The objective is to create a **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)** that meets the following criteria:

- The project should consist of at least one webpage (frontend) and one backend canister.
- On the webpage, users can log in, create profiles, and register with the organization.
- Registered users can create proposals and participate in voting on them.
- The organization should have control over an external system, such as a website, a token ledger, an NFT collection, or a treasury.
- Approved proposals should be automatically executed and trigger various actions, like changing webpage designs, minting or burning tokens, altering NFT colors, or transferring funds from the treasury to another wallet - feel free to get more creative!
- The code should be easy to understand and concise.
- The code must be secure, safe, and free of any bugs.

### ¬©Ô∏è¬†****Example****

Here is an example of such a project. This dApp was build by a student during Motoko Bootcamp (January 2023). Feel free to take inspiration from it (but don‚Äôt copy it!)

3. Modifying an **[external website](https://7qusb-uqaaa-aaaak-qbvaa-cai.ic0.app/)** linked to the DAO.

However, the project lacks the ability to:

- Set up a profile and register with the organization.
